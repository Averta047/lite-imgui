# Lite Dear ImGui

lite-imgui is a lite version of the original [ocornut's Dear ImGui 1.79](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/v1.79) which is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++

- This project aims to make Dear ImGui even smaller and lighter, with optimizations for various use cases, including game UI development.
- It focuses on simplicity and styling, offering more customization options.
- It reduces the use of redefined functions, structures, and static variables (such as math-related ones) to streamline the library.
